# Endpoint FileSystem Challenge

This was a fun challenge, thank you for your consideration!

To run the filesystem, run the following commands...

``` 
git clone git@github.com:Nilando/endpoint_challenge.git
cd endpoint_challenge
cargo test
cargo run
```

## Review
This took about 4 hours of work.

Things I would do next
- use symbol map to avoid copying strings everywhere
- add a CD command
- allow commands to take multiple arguments
